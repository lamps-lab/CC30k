The flat clusters in 5-dimensional space cannot be visualized directly. Instead, we again apply UMAP to the data, compressing the vectors to be two-dimensional and therefore plottable on a page or computer monitor.

(2018); Chen et al. (2018). But deployment of these defenses is not feasible when the defender is the user/consumer of the classifier, without access to its training set or to any prior knowledge of the backdoor pattern Wang et al. (2020). A major defense approach suitable for this scenario is a reverse-engineering defense (RED). In general, a RED treats each class as a putative BA target class and trial-reverse-engineers a BP. Then, detection statistics are derived from the estimated pattern for each putative target class. If there is a BA, the pattern estimated for the true BA target class will likely be correlated with the true BP used by the attacker, such that the associated statistics will likely be anomalous referenced against the statistics for the other (non-BA) classes Wang et al. (2019); Xiang et al. (2020). Notably, RED-based anomaly detection does not require supervision from clean classifiers trained for the same domain like, e.g., Kolouri et al. (2020). Although existing REDs have achieved leading performance in many practical detection tasks, a fundamental limitation still remains. RED-based anomaly detection typically requires estimating a null distribution used to assess anomalies, with the number of detection statistics (samples) used to estimate this null a function of the number of classes K. Wang et al. (2019) uses O(K) statistics, and Xiang et al. (2020) uses even more statistics – O(K(2)). These methods are not applicable for domains with K = 2, e.g. sentiment classification Gao et al.

This means the self-pretrained encoder and decoder can be frozen, and we only need to learn a linear converter to connect them from the paired seismic data and velocity map. This introduces an interesting insight into FWI: the self-consistent representation within each domain is associated with simpler mapping across domains. We name this method SimFWI, as it simplifies the mapping (linear) in FWI between seismic data and velocity map via domain-independent self-supervised learning. Furthermore, SimFWI provides a better understanding of the relationship among multiple FWI datasets with different subsurface structures. We found that these datasets can share both encoders and decoders, but have different linear mappings between the latent spaces of two domains (i.e. seismic data and velocity map). Essentially, the two domains have a piece-wise linear relationship over multiple datasets. In addition, we found a correlation between the linear layers singular values and the complexity of the dataset. SimFWI achieves solid performance on multiple FWI datasets.

"Evci et al. (2020b) recently proposed a possible interpretation for the behavior of IMP and the success of the LTH. The authors posit that lottery tickets cannot be considered random initializations but that a lottery ticket contains a prior for rediscovering the solution of the model from which it was pruned. We call this hypothesis the regurgitating tickets interpretation (RTI): a lottery ticket retrains to a similar optimum compared to the network from which it was pruned. As discussed in Evci et al. (2020b), the RTI allows us to informally understand several key questions regarding IMP, such as why lottery tickets transfer or why they are robust to perturbations. To empirically validate the RTI, Evci et al. (2020b) evaluate the similarity of trained lottery tickets on LeNet and ResNet50. Although enticing, the authors perform the evaluation only at a single sparsity level. Moreover, this does not conclusively prove the RTI, as alternative explanations remain possible. Solutions from successive pruning rounds might merely be close as a side effect of the very stable training environment or other properties of the lottery tickets. We design a new experiment to affirm the causal relationship between the success of IMP and the RTI across sparsities and on various vision architectures. We modify the loss function to repel previously found optima. We show that this removes the ability of IMP to find lottery tickets. On the other hand, this has no noticeable effect on the performance of random reinitalizations. Finally, we explore what notion of similarity is entailed by the RTI and how it is affected by the stability of training. We show that when IMP becomes stable, all pruning rounds have a very small angular distance. Evci et al. (2020b) make the stronger claim that IMP retrains into the same basin. We find that this is not necessarily the case at very low or high sparsities. The LTH has spawned the idea that lottery tickets could be generated in a mostly data-independent fashion without relying on the very costly IMP. This would open up the possibility of fully sparse training without any prior dense training. For example, Morcos et al. (2019) hint at ""the possibility of parameterizing the distribution of such tickets, allowing us to sample generic, dataset-independent winning tickets."" Our evidence for the RTI indicates that such efforts might be misguided, as the construction of a lottery ticket requires prior knowledge of a dense solution. This is in line with Frankle et al. (2020b), who empirically examine current attempts at data-independent pruning at initialization (PAI), and show that these attempts significantly underperform compared to IMP. We hope that an improved understanding of IMP and the LTH, will allow future work to design better pruning and sparse optimization algorithms. In summary, our key contributions are as follows: 1. We demonstrate that the lottery ticket hypothesis can be extended to large networks and show that it is possible to train large neural networks from scratch without rewinding by using a sufficiently large batch size. This reinforces the hypothesis of Frankle et al. (2020a) that finding lottery tickets is possible when training is stable with respect to linear mode connectivity.",Positive

"Evci et al. (2020b) recently proposed a possible interpretation for the behavior of IMP and the success of the LTH. The authors posit that lottery tickets cannot be considered random initializations but that a lottery ticket contains a prior for rediscovering the solution of the model from which it was pruned. We call this hypothesis the regurgitating tickets interpretation (RTI): a lottery ticket retrains to a similar optimum compared to the network from which it was pruned. As discussed in Evci et al. (2020b), the RTI allows us to informally understand several key questions regarding IMP, such as why lottery tickets transfer or why they are robust to perturbations. To empirically validate the RTI, Evci et al. (2020b) evaluate the similarity of trained lottery tickets on LeNet and ResNet50. Although enticing, the authors perform the evaluation only at a single sparsity level. Moreover, this does not conclusively prove the RTI, as alternative explanations remain possible. Solutions from successive pruning rounds might merely be close as a side effect of the very stable training environment or other properties of the lottery tickets. We design a new experiment to affirm the causal relationship between the success of IMP and the RTI across sparsities and on various vision architectures. We modify the loss function to repel previously found optima. We show that this removes the ability of IMP to find lottery tickets. On the other hand, this has no noticeable effect on the performance of random reinitalizations. Finally, we explore what notion of similarity is entailed by the RTI and how it is affected by the stability of training. We show that when IMP becomes stable, all pruning rounds have a very small angular distance. Evci et al. (2020b) make the stronger claim that IMP retrains into the same basin. We find that this is not necessarily the case at very low or high sparsities. The LTH has spawned the idea that lottery tickets could be generated in a mostly data-independent fashion without relying on the very costly IMP. This would open up the possibility of fully sparse training without any prior dense training. For example, Morcos et al. (2019) hint at ""the possibility of parameterizing the distribution of such tickets, allowing us to sample generic, dataset-independent winning tickets."" Our evidence for the RTI indicates that such efforts might be misguided, as the construction of a lottery ticket requires prior knowledge of a dense solution. This is in line with Frankle et al. (2020b), who empirically examine current attempts at data-independent pruning at initialization (PAI), and show that these attempts significantly underperform compared to IMP.",Positive

(2022). However, none of these studies investigated bilevel optimization when the outer objective is in the form of compositions of functions. In this work, we introduce the compositional bilevel optimization problem as a novel pipeline for instance reweighted AT, and establish its first known convergence rate. Stochastic compositional optimization. Stochastic compositional optimization (SCO) deals with the minimization of compositions of stochastic functions. Wang et al. (2017) proposed the compositional stochastic gradient descent (SCGD) algorithm as a pioneering method for SCO problems and established its convergence rate. Many extentions of SCGD have been proposed with improved rates, including accelerated and adaptive SCGD methods Wang et al. (2016); Tutunov et al.

"(2020) employ normalizing flows and variational inference for enabling tractable counterfactual inference, Sanchez & Tsaftaris (2022) use diffusion models for counterfactual estimation, Axel Sauer (2021) proposes counterfactual generative networks, Dash et al. (2022) incorporates a structural causal model (SCM) in a variant of Adversarially Learned Inference for generating counterfactual images. Normalizing flow-based methods for answering counterfactual queries has received a lot of attention in no time. For example, Pawlowski et al. (2020)s work on healthy magnetic resonance images of the brain has been extended to account for the clinical and radiological phenotype of multiple sclerosis (MS) by Reinhold et al. (2021). Wang et al. (2021) perform counterfactual inference to achieve harmonization of brain imaging data with different protocols and from different sites in a clinical study. From a deep learning perspective, an exogenous variable might be considered as an inferred latent variable. To infer the state of the latent noise attached to an endogenous variable, we typically model a normalizing flow, perform amortized variational inference (in the case of very high dimensional variables) (Pawlowski et al., 2020) or use deterministic forward diffusion(Sanchez & Tsaftaris, 2022). Our ability to infer a latent variable comes at a computational cost as well as a statistical cost. To illustrate, the framework for counterfactual estimation by inferring exogenous noises via normalising flows parameterizes each structural assignment of an SCM as an invertible mechanism. Each mechanism explicitly calculates its inverse to enable efficient abduction of exogenous noises. These invertible architectures are typically computationally heavy. For a description of normalizing flows, see Appendix A and Papamakarios et al. (2019). However, given an SCM, in practice, we are interested in counterfactual queries involving a few variables (not all)! For example, Reinhold et al. (2021) studied what the brain image of the subject would look like if the subject did not have lesions, given the observation that they have a 60 mL lesion load. While the proposed SCM consists of age, lesion volume of the subject, duration of MS symptoms, slice number, brain volume, biological sex, image, ventricle volume, and the expanded disability severity score. Hence, it is quite natural to ask for noise variables that we can get rid of from abducting. While Pawlowski et al. (2020) have mentioned (on a footnote) in the case of brain imaging example that abduction of the noise attached to sex is not necessary as sex has no causal parents in the SCM1 (Figure 5, Pawlowski et al.",Neutral

"(2015); Guo et al. (2016)). These methods are computationally more expensive than dense training and are useful only for FLOPS and memory reduction in inference. Pruning before Training: Such methods are inspired by the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (Frankle & Carbin (2019)), which tries to find a sparse weight mask (subnetwork) that can be trained from scratch to match the quality of dense trained model. However, they use an iterative pruning scheme that is repeated for several full training passes to find the mask. SNIP (Lee et al. (2019)) preserves the loss after pruning based on connection sensitivity. GraSP (Wang et al. (2020)) prunes connection such that it preserves the networks gradient flow. SynFlow (Tanaka et al. (2020)) uses iterative synaptic flow pruning to preserve the total flow of synaptic strength (global pruning at initialization with no data and no backpropagation). 3SP (van Amersfoort et al. (2020)) introduces compute-aware pruning of channels (structured pruning). The main advantage of these methods is that they are compute and memory efficient in every iteration. However, they often suffer from significant loss of accuracy. Note that, the weight pruning mask is fixed throughout the training. Pruning during Training: For these methods, the weight pruning mask evolves dynamically with training. Methods of this category can belong to either sparse-to-sparse or dense-to-sparse training. In sparse-to-sparse training, we have a sparse model to start with (based on sparsity budget) and the budget sparsity is maintained throughout the training. SET (Mocanu et al.

"Archibald et al. (2019), in a paper published pre-COVID-19, draw attention only to the ‘potential’ of VOIP platforms for interviewing in qualitative research and highlight the limited literature in this area and the potential issues with different operating systems, functionality with low bandwidth and security settings. Their advice on using video conferencing during social distancing is, unsurprisingly, to identify the platform that best fits the project. We considered three potential platforms for conducting our interviews with policymakers and practitioners: Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business. These seemed to be the video conferencing platforms already in use by some parts of the criminal justice agencies, and their use spread as working at home directives came into place. Archibald et al. (2019) concluded that researchers and participants were positive about Zoom interviews in terms of features including convenience, ease of use, security and personal connection. Marhefka et al. (2020), in a COVID-era paper, were similarly positive about Zoom for working with people and professionals in the HIV field during social distancing. The majority of police forces in our study installed MS Teams in March 2020, so we used that platform in police interviews, and for them the security settings of this platform made it preferable. Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS) switched between different preferred VOIPs between March and August. Interviews with Magistrates Association representatives were conducted via Zoom (secured with meeting password). The Home Office and the Crown Prosecution Service used either Zoom or MS Teams depending on who we were interviewing. The suggestion that professional bodies were unfamiliar with video conferencing use became outdated after the first half of 2020, and the key factor in our choice of platform was that we used any platform preferred by our participants. There was some initial concern in 2020 about the security of video conferencing platforms, so we used all the security measures that were available on the platforms (e.g. passwords and waiting rooms) to mitigate any potential problem. Our interviews were carried out with respondents predominantly in two environments – offices and homes. These were obviously the result of the personal preference of respondents and partly dictated by the ‘work from home’ guidance issued during the COVID-19 lockdown periods. One might expect that professional environments allow professional contexts (interviews that were more formal) to predominate, but we did not experience different levels of intimacy/distancing/professionalism within any of the environments people chose to be interviewed. A few people chose to obscure their backgrounds, so we did not know where they physically ‘sat’, but again there was no noticeable difference in the ‘feel’ of the interview. This was not the case for the two respondents who could not (for technological reasons) use their laptop camera. This did seem to engender a distance between the interviewer/interviewee. In essence, it changed a face-to-face (online) interview into a phone call, and although the transmission of information was unaffected (they seemed to be similar in character to other interviews), we felt more distanced from the interviewee. For the academic team, the settings for the interviews were a home-office and a kitchen. The home/work environments for interviewers and interviewees were, in fact, very similar. This lessened power-imbalances and gave opportunities for the early establishment of rapport. O’Connor et al. (2008) outline the ways in which researchers have attempted to replicate the process and experience of conducting face-to-face interviews online, including establishing rapport and sharing personal information – commenting on a pet curled up on a sofa behind the interviewer, how nice a desk light looked and so on.",Negative

"The widely used structured pruning methodL1-norm based structured pruning Renda et al. (2020) removes filters with the lowest L1-norm values, whereas the most recent methodPolarization-based structured pruning Zhuang et al. (2020) improves it by using a regularizer on scaling factors of filters and pruning filters whose scaling factors are below than a threshold. These two methods both assume that the weight values of a filter can be used as an indicator about the importance of that filter, much like how LTH uses weight values in unstructured pruning. However, we observe that weight-based structured pruning methods cannot produce accurate pruned models. For example, to prune ResNet-56 on CIFAR-10 with no loss in top-1 accuracy, L1-norm based structured pruning can achieve at most only 1.15 model compression, and Polarization-norm based structured pruning can achieve at most only 1.89 inference speedup. The reason is that, some filters, even though their weight values are small, can still produce useful non-zero activation values that are important for learning features during backpropagation. That is, filters with small values may have large activations. We propose that the activation values of filters are more effective in finding unimportant filters to prune. Activations like ReLu enable non-linear operations, and enable convolutional layers to act as feature detectors. If an activation value is small, then its corresponding feature detector is not important for prediction tasks. So activation values, i.e., the intermediate output tensors after the non-linear activation, not only detect features of training dataset, but also contain the information of convolution layers that act as feature detectors for prediction tasks. We present a visual motivation in Figure 1(a). The figure shows the activation output of 16 filters of a convolution layer on one input image. The first image on the left is the original image, and the second image is the input features after data augmentation. We observe that some filters extract image features with high activation patterns, e.g., the 6th and 12th filters. In comparison, the activation outputs of some filters are close to zero, such as the 2nd, 14th, and 16th. Therefore, from visual inspection, removing filters with weak activation patterns is likely to have low impact on the final accuracy of the pruned model. There is a natural connection between our activation-based pruning approach and the related attention-based knowledge transfer works (Zagoruyko & Komodakis (2016)).",Neutral

In RL, local maxima can often be global as well for many cases (Agarwal et al., 2020b).2 Zero-order optimization or policy gradient algorithms can converge to local maxima and become natural potential competitors. They are widely believed to be less sampleefficient than the model-based approach because the latter can leverage the extrapolation power of the parameterized models. Theoretically, our formulation aims to characterize this phenomenon with results showing that the model-based approachs sample complexity mostly depends (polynomially) on the complexity of the model class, whereas policy gradient algorithms sample complexity polynomially depend on the dimensionality of policy parameters (in RL) or actions (in bandit). Our technical goal is to answer the following question: Can we design algorithms that converge to approximate local maxima with sample complexities that depend only and polynomially on the complexity measure of the dynamics/reward class? We note that this question is open even if the dynamics hypothesis class is finite, and the complexity measure is the logarithm of its size. The question is also open even for nonlinear bandit problems (where dynamics class is replaced by reward function class), with which we start our research. We consider first nonlinear bandit with deterministic reward where the reward function is given by (, a) for action a  A under instance   . We use sequential Rademacher complexity (Rakhlin et al., 2015a;b) to capture the complexity of the reward function . Our main result for nonlinear bandit is stated as follows. Theorem 1.1 (Informal version of Theorem 3.1). Suppose the sequential Rademacher complexity of a loss function class (defined later) induced by the reward function class {(, ) :   } is bounded by  R()Tpolylog(T ). Then, there exists an algorithm (ViOlin, Alg. 1) that finds an -approximate local maximum with (R() 8) samples. In contrast to zero-order optimization, which does not use the parameterization of  and has a sample complexity depending on the action dimension, our bound only depends on the complexity of the reward function class. This suggests that our algorithm exploits the extrapolation power of the reward function class. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first action-dimension-free result for both linear and nonlinear bandit problems. More concretely, we instantiate our theorem to the following settings and get new results (2)The all-local-maxima-are-global condition only needs to hold to the ground-truth total expected reward function. This potentially can allow disentangled assumptions on the ground-truth instance and the hypothesis class. that leverage the model complexity (more in Section A.1). 1. Linear bandit with finite parameter space . Because  is concave in action a, our result leads to a sample complexity O(poly(log||, 1/ )) for finding an approximate optimal action. In this case both zero-order optimization and the SquareCB algorithm in Foster, Rakhlin (2020) have sample complexity/regret that depend on the dimension of action space dA.",Positive

(2021) in the context of universal learning (which is another definition of learnability in the same spirit as PAC learning) suggests that a combinatorial measure that is more restrictive than the Littlestone dimension is unlikely. In particular, they show that there are only three possible rates in universal learning with the fastest being characterised by the littlestone dimension and the slowest by VC dimension. This makes Theorem 2 more likely. Some initial progress towards this has been made by Golowich and Livni (2021) who proved, in the oblivious setting, that the number of mistakes grows logarithmically in T . This, in fact, disproves theorem 2 for the setting of oblivious adversaries (1). Further, even for oblivious adversaries, it is possible to ask whether Theorem 2 can be proved for α being any monotonically increasing function in T . An interesting outcome of a proof for Theorem 2 is a general algorithm to convert an online learner to a private online learner. We promise a wheel of parmigiano reggiano to whoever proves Theorem 1 or a tub of biriyani for solving Theorem 2. 1. In Golowich and Livni (2021) the authors also provide some results also for the setting of adaptive adversaries, but under a definition of differential privacy more suited to the setting of adaptive adversaries",Negative
