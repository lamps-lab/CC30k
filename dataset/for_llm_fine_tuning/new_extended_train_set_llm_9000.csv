"In particular, we train two masked autoencoders (MAE) He et al. (2022) separately, i.e. one for seismic data and one for velocity maps (see Figure 1b). Surprisingly, we observe a linear correlation between the two latent spaces. This means the self-pretrained encoder and decoder can be frozen, and we only need to learn a linear converter to connect them from the paired seismic data and velocity map. This introduces an interesting insight into FWI: the self-consistent representation within each domain is associated with simpler mapping across domains. We name this method SimFWI, as it simplifies the mapping (linear) in FWI between seismic data and velocity map via domain-independent self-supervised learning. Furthermore, SimFWI provides a better understanding of the relationship among multiple FWI datasets with different subsurface structures. We found that these datasets can share both encoders and decoders, but have different linear mappings between the latent spaces of two domains (i.e. seismic data and velocity map). Essentially, the two domains have a piece-wise linear relationship over multiple datasets. In addition, we found a correlation between the linear layers singular values and the complexity of the dataset. SimFWI achieves solid performance on multiple FWI datasets.

For example, in the image colorization experiments, the pretrained vision model learns the common colors of different objects from the massive unlabeled data in a self-supervised way. As visualized in Figure 3, the vision model learns common knowledge such as stop signs are usually red, and the background of a horse is usually green while manatees are marine mammals therefore the background is usually blue.

(2020)s work on healthy magnetic resonance images of the brain has been extended to account for the clinical and radiological phenotype of multiple sclerosis (MS) by Reinhold et al. (2021). Wang et al. (2021) perform counterfactual inference to achieve harmonization of brain imaging data with different protocols and from different sites in a clinical study. From a deep learning perspective, an exogenous variable might be considered as an inferred latent variable. To infer the state of the latent noise attached to an endogenous variable, we typically model a normalizing flow, perform amortized variational inference (in the case of very high dimensional variables) (Pawlowski et al., 2020) or use deterministic forward diffusion(Sanchez & Tsaftaris, 2022). Our ability to infer a latent variable comes at a computational cost as well as a statistical cost. To illustrate, the framework for counterfactual estimation by inferring exogenous noises via normalising flows parameterizes each structural assignment of an SCM as an invertible mechanism. Each mechanism explicitly calculates its inverse to enable efficient abduction of exogenous noises. These invertible architectures are typically computationally heavy. For a description of normalizing flows, see Appendix A and Papamakarios et al. (2019). However, given an SCM, in practice, we are interested in counterfactual queries involving a few variables (not all)! For example, Reinhold et al. (2021) studied what the brain image of the subject would look like if the subject did not have lesions, given the observation that they have a 60 mL lesion load. While the proposed SCM consists of age, lesion volume of the subject, duration of MS symptoms, slice number, brain volume, biological sex, image, ventricle volume, and the expanded disability severity score. Hence, it is quite natural to ask for noise variables that we can get rid of from abducting. While Pawlowski et al. (2020) have mentioned (on a footnote) in the case of brain imaging example that abduction of the noise attached to sex is not necessary as sex has no causal parents in the SCM1 (Figure 5, Pawlowski et al.",Neutral

After a number of rounds, the estimator is refined to achieve the optimal statistical rate. Such procedures, typically performed with continuous optimization algorithms, are generally inapplicable to non-smooth problems due to their requirement that the loss function needs to be sufficiently smooth, although a non-smooth regularization term is permitted. The understanding of the multi-round improvement under the non-smooth scenarios is still in many ways nascent, and existing analyses mostly depend on the specific statistical model. Chen et al. (2019), Wang et al. (2019), Chen et al. (2021), and Tan et al. (2021) proposed remedies for specific continuous objective functions that violate second-order differentiability, mainly featuring quantile regression and linear support vector machines. Other estimators obtained by minimizing non-smooth objectives must be analyzed in a case-by-case scenario, as a non-smooth loss usually leads to a slow rate of statistical convergence as well as deficiencies in algorithmic convergence. In this paper, we spotlight the semi-parametric binary response model whose corresponding loss function is non-convex and not continuous, both violating the assumptions in the above literature.

"The widely used structured pruning methodL1-norm based structured pruning Renda et al. (2020) removes filters with the lowest L1-norm values, whereas the most recent methodPolarization-based structured pruning Zhuang et al. (2020) improves it by using a regularizer on scaling factors of filters and pruning filters whose scaling factors are below than a threshold. These two methods both assume that the weight values of a filter can be used as an indicator about the importance of that filter, much like how LTH uses weight values in unstructured pruning. However, we observe that weight-based structured pruning methods cannot produce accurate pruned models. For example, to prune ResNet-56 on CIFAR-10 with no loss in top-1 accuracy, L1-norm based structured pruning can achieve at most only 1.15 model compression, and Polarization-norm based structured pruning can achieve at most only 1.89 inference speedup. The reason is that, some filters, even though their weight values are small, can still produce useful non-zero activation values that are important for learning features during backpropagation. That is, filters with small values may have large activations. We propose that the activation values of filters are more effective in finding unimportant filters to prune. Activations like ReLu enable non-linear operations, and enable convolutional layers to act as feature detectors. If an activation value is small, then its corresponding feature detector is not important for prediction tasks. So activation values, i.e., the intermediate output tensors after the non-linear activation, not only detect features of training dataset, but also contain the information of convolution layers that act as feature detectors for prediction tasks. We present a visual motivation in Figure 1(a). The figure shows the activation output of 16 filters of a convolution layer on one input image. The first image on the left is the original image, and the second image is the input features after data augmentation. We observe that some filters extract image features with high activation patterns, e.g., the 6th and 12th filters. In comparison, the activation outputs of some filters are close to zero, such as the 2nd, 14th, and 16th. Therefore, from visual inspection, removing filters with weak activation patterns is likely to have low impact on the final accuracy of the pruned model. There is a natural connection between our activation-based pruning approach and the related attention-based knowledge transfer works (Zagoruyko & Komodakis (2016)).",Neutral

"(2015); Guo et al. (2016)). These methods are computationally more expensive than dense training and are useful only for FLOPS and memory reduction in inference. Pruning before Training: Such methods are inspired by the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (Frankle & Carbin (2019)), which tries to find a sparse weight mask (subnetwork) that can be trained from scratch to match the quality of dense trained model. However, they use an iterative pruning scheme that is repeated for several full training passes to find the mask. SNIP (Lee et al. (2019)) preserves the loss after pruning based on connection sensitivity. GraSP (Wang et al. (2020)) prunes connection such that it preserves the networks gradient flow. SynFlow (Tanaka et al. (2020)) uses iterative synaptic flow pruning to preserve the total flow of synaptic strength (global pruning at initialization with no data and no backpropagation). 3SP (van Amersfoort et al. (2020)) introduces compute-aware pruning of channels (structured pruning). The main advantage of these methods is that they are compute and memory efficient in every iteration. However, they often suffer from significant loss of accuracy. Note that, the weight pruning mask is fixed throughout the training. Pruning during Training: For these methods, the weight pruning mask evolves dynamically with training. Methods of this category can belong to either sparse-to-sparse or dense-to-sparse training. In sparse-to-sparse training, we have a sparse model to start with (based on sparsity budget) and the budget sparsity is maintained throughout the training. SET (Mocanu et al. (2018)) pioneered this approach where they replaced a fraction of least magnitude weights by random weights for better exploration. DSR (Mostafa & Wang (2019)) allowed sparsity budget to be non-uniform across layers heuristically, e.",Positive
