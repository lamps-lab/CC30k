(2022) incorporates a structural causal model (SCM) in a variant of Adversarially Learned Inference for generating counterfactual images. Normalizing flow-based methods for answering counterfactual queries has received a lot of attention in no time. For example, Pawlowski et al. (2020)s work on healthy magnetic resonance images of the brain has been extended to account for the clinical and radiological phenotype of multiple sclerosis (MS) by Reinhold et al. (2021). Wang et al. (2021) perform counterfactual inference to achieve harmonization of brain imaging data with different protocols and from different sites in a clinical study. From a deep learning perspective, an exogenous variable might be considered as an inferred latent variable. To infer the state of the latent noise attached to an endogenous variable, we typically model a normalizing flow, perform amortized variational inference (in the case of very high dimensional variables) (Pawlowski et al., 2020) or use deterministic forward diffusion(Sanchez & Tsaftaris, 2022). Our ability to infer a latent variable comes at a computational cost as well as a statistical cost. To illustrate, the framework for counterfactual estimation by inferring exogenous noises via normalising flows parameterizes each structural assignment of an SCM as an invertible mechanism. Each mechanism explicitly calculates its inverse to enable efficient abduction of exogenous noises. These invertible architectures are typically computationally heavy. For a description of normalizing flows, see Appendix A and Papamakarios et al. (2019). However, given an SCM, in practice, we are interested in counterfactual queries involving a few variables (not all)! For example, Reinhold et al. (2021) studied what the brain image of the subject would look like if the subject did not have lesions, given the observation that they have a 60 mL lesion load. While the proposed SCM consists of age, lesion volume of the subject, duration of MS symptoms, slice number, brain volume, biological sex, image, ventricle volume, and the expanded disability severity score. Hence, it is quite natural to ask for noise variables that we can get rid of from abducting. While Pawlowski et al. (2020) have mentioned (on a footnote) in the case of brain imaging example that abduction of the noise attached to sex is not necessary as sex has no causal parents in the SCM1 (Figure 5, Pawlowski et al.

(2016)). These methods are computationally more expensive than dense training and are useful only for FLOPS and memory reduction in inference. Pruning before Training: Such methods are inspired by the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (Frankle & Carbin (2019)), which tries to find a sparse weight mask (subnetwork) that can be trained from scratch to match the quality of dense trained model. However, they use an iterative pruning scheme that is repeated for several full training passes to find the mask. SNIP (Lee et al. (2019)) preserves the loss after pruning based on connection sensitivity. GraSP (Wang et al. (2020)) prunes connection such that it preserves the networks gradient flow. SynFlow (Tanaka et al. (2020)) uses iterative synaptic flow pruning to preserve the total flow of synaptic strength (global pruning at initialization with no data and no backpropagation). 3SP (van Amersfoort et al. (2020)) introduces compute-aware pruning of channels (structured pruning). The main advantage of these methods is that they are compute and memory efficient in every iteration. However, they often suffer from significant loss of accuracy. Note that, the weight pruning mask is fixed throughout the training. Pruning during Training: For these methods, the weight pruning mask evolves dynamically with training. Methods of this category can belong to either sparse-to-sparse or dense-to-sparse training. In sparse-to-sparse training, we have a sparse model to start with (based on sparsity budget) and the budget sparsity is maintained throughout the training. SET (Mocanu et al. (2018)) pioneered this approach where they replaced a fraction of least magnitude weights by random weights for better exploration. DSR (Mostafa & Wang (2019)) allowed sparsity budget to be non-uniform across layers heuristically, e. [/INST] Positive"}

(2019) and GómezValverde et al. (2019), accompanied by filters which are capable of retrieving features of importance required for classification. We need to use a substantial image data collection with more than 14000 images in order to finetune these networks. For instance, Kolář and Jan (2008) had detected glaucoma on the basis of fractal description which was followed up by classification. Fractal aspects can be utilized as highlights for retinal nerve fiber misfortunes recognition, which is an indication of glaucomatous eye. Maheswari et al. (2017) accomplishing the objective by utilizing LS-SVM (Least Squares Support Vector Machine) to rank the correntropy features extracted by EWT (Empirical Wavelet Transform). In the interim, another school of thought proposed the analysis of the cup-to-disc ratio (CDR). The CDR communicates the extent of the disc occupied by the cup. For an eye that is typical, CDR ought to be somewhere in the range of 0.3 and 0.5. With progressive neuro-retinal degeneration, the ratio in question increases. Vision is totally lost at a CDR worth of around 0.8. Additionally, the method put forward in this paper restricts the extraction area by excluding the blood vessel region, and sample images of these structures are manually collected. Mishra et al. (2011) proposes a technique for segmentation utilizing the concept of adaptive thresholding and it utilizes the features acquired from the picture, like mean and standard deviation, to eliminate data from the red and green channels of a fundus image and obtain an image which contains just the optic nerve head region in both the channels. The optic circle is divided from the red channel and optic cup from the green channel respectively by Issac et al. (2015). However, their method failed when tested on low contrast images due to the small dataset used. [/INST] Negative"}

(2022) demonstrate that grokking generalization speed can be accelerated in a simple embeddingdecoder model by using a larger learning rate for the embedding than for the decoder. This is in line with findings by Heckel & Yilmaz (2020) on epoch-wise double descent, where decreasing learning rates in later layers (which learn faster) aligns pattern learning speeds. We consider this further evidence that both grokking and epoch-wise double descent occur as a result of similar learning dynamics resulting from different speeds of pattern development. Nanda & Lieberum (2022) investigate grokking through mechanistic interpretability, with findings in line with our results (specifically observing the development of a Type 3 pattern).

(2020) with  (x) = x +  1 , with   N (0, I) and  uniformly sampled as   U(0, 1). As shown in the quantitative results in Table 2 and visualizations in Figure 3, with proper degrees of corruption, restoring the original images may require the network to infer the general content given the corrupted pixels, and recover the details using the knowledge learned from the true samples and stored in the network weights. For example, in the image colorization experiments, the pretrained vision model learns the common colors of different objects from the massive unlabeled data in a self-supervised way. As visualized in Figure 3, the vision model learns common knowledge such as stop signs are usually red, and the background of a horse is usually green while manatees are marine mammals therefore the background is usually blue. Summarizing such knowledge requires the vision models to learn identifying objects first, therefore transferable network weights and feature representations can be obtained from pretraining. And as shown in the Denoising row of Figure 3, with strong noise injected to the input, the model is able to recover objects that are almost invisible. This finding potentially connects our pretraining method with genitive models Song et al. (2021a); Ho et al. (2020); Song & Ermon (2019); Song et al. [/INST] Positive"}

(2020) with  (x) = x +  1 , with   N (0, I) and  uniformly sampled as   U(0, 1). As shown in the quantitative results in Table 2 and visualizations in Figure 3, with proper degrees of corruption, restoring the original images may require the network to infer the general content given the corrupted pixels, and recover the details using the knowledge learned from the true samples and stored in the network weights. For example, in the image colorization experiments, the pretrained vision model learns the common colors of different objects from the massive unlabeled data in a self-supervised way. As visualized in Figure 3, the vision model learns common knowledge such as stop signs are usually red, and the background of a horse is usually green while manatees are marine mammals therefore the background is usually blue. Summarizing such knowledge requires the vision models to learn identifying objects first, therefore transferable network weights and feature representations can be obtained from pretraining. And as shown in the Denoising row of Figure 3, with strong noise injected to the input, the model is able to recover objects that are almost invisible. This finding potentially connects our pretraining method with genitive models Song et al. (2021a); Ho et al. (2020); Song & Ermon (2019); Song et al. (2021b). We will further investigate the connections in future efforts. [/INST] Positive"}

However, it is worth mentioning that the first-order method in Diakonikolas [2020] is different from first-order extragradient method and first-order dual extrapolation method which are known to achieve an optimal convergence to an ǫ-weak solution. As far as we know, it remains unclear how to design the high-order generalization of such new Halpern iteration methods. Finally, the complexity bound of O(ǫ−2/(p+1)) could not be derived beyond the monotone setting if only the Minty condition holds. Indeed, the key ingredient for proving the complexity bound of O(ǫ−2/(p+1)) is the use of averaged iterates in our new method. Such averaging technique is standard for the monotone setting but is not known to be valid yet when only the Minty condition holds. In addition, the fast convergence of Halpern iteration in Diakonikolas [2020] for achieving an ǫ-strong solution heavily relies on the monotonicity assumption and could not be extended to the setting when only the Minty condition holds.

The key idea is to use the lower bound for finding an ǫ-weak solution [Ouyang and Xu, 2021] and the algorithmic reductions to derive lower bounds. However, such a reduction is mostly based on the high-order generalization of Halpern iteration and is thus beyond the scope of the current manuscript. In particular, we have developed a simple and optimal pth-order VI method for finding an ǫ-weak solution in the monotone setting. However, the optimal algorithm for finding an ǫ-strong solution in the monotone setting is likely to be different as evidenced by Diakonikolas [2020]. Computing an ǫ-strong solution and/or an ǫ-weak solution are complementary, yet different, and they indeed deserve separate study in their own right. [/INST] Negative"}
