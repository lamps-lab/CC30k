For each equation, 20 training examples and 20 test examples are generated. For equations 1 though 6, x is sampled from a Uniform(-1,1) distribution; for equation 7, x is sampled from a Uniform(0,2) distribution; for equation 8, x is sampled from a Uniform(0,4) distribution; for equations 9 through 12, x and y are sampled from a Uniform(0,1) distribution. For each equation, we allow a time limit of 10,000 seconds for generating upper and lower bounds. The operators include unary operators sine, cosine, natural log, and natural exponential, and binary operators addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. As noted in Section 2.2, our Conjecturing framework does not allow repeated invariants in conjectures. Therefore, most of the equations in Table 3 cannot be recovered by our framework. For each equation, we first evaluate the ability of the conjectured bounds to approximate the equation by reporting the normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) as defined and reported by Petersen et al. (2021) and described in Section 5.3. We report NRMSE for the conjecture with the lowest mean average error for the training examples. The results in Table 3 indicate that our Conjecturing framework is able to recover only equation 11 f = x. It is able to do so despite the fact that the exponent operator is not included. Conjecturing produces the expression e log(x) and simplified it to x. The NRMSE values for the best bounds for the other instances range from 0.22 to 1.08.

As practical QNNs will likely need to contain thousands of neurons, this result shows that almost all such networks will have gradients that are negligibly small and cannot be trained efficiently even on a quantum computer. Moreover, recent results by Ortiz et al Marrero et al. [2020] have shown that the barren plateau problem can be even more significant for deep QNNs. Specifically, entanglement between the visible and hidden layers in a QNN can cause the gradient to become exponentially small. Specifically, they show that with probability at least 1− 2−Ω(nh−nv) that the gradient will be in O(‖M̂‖ √ 2nv−nh) if the states satisfy a volume law for entanglement (which is typical for random quantum states) where M(θ) = Tr ( M̂σ(θ) ) and M̂ is a Hermitian operator. This shows that even if the typicality arguments of the McClean et al. McClean et al. [2018] result do not hold, then entanglement between the hidden and visible layers can still destroy the ability to train the network with respect to the bounded loss function. Additional results show that even noise can induce a similar form of a barren plateau and thus any local optimization cannot be expected to be efficient in general for QNNs that satisfy these requirements. There are several approaches to overcoming barren plateaus that are either based on empirical evidence Grant et al. [2019], Skolik et al. [2021] or constrained to a specific architecture Pesah et al.

The extension to hybrid FL is not clear as now multiple clients hold copies of the same dual variables and the local coordinate descent that FedDCD performs is no longer valid. Furthermore, the proof results given for FedDCD require smooth loss functions which eliminate many common loss functions such as hinge loss. Our convergence results do not require smoothness of the loss functions. FedDCD does not mention privacy considerations in the case that the mapping between primal and dual variables can be inverted to reveal information about the data held on clients. We address these privacy concerns with suitable homomorphic encryption steps in HyFDCA. We note that to the best of our knowledge, HyFDCA is the only primal-dual algorithm that can handle vertical FL. There has been substantially less work in vertical FL where each client has all of the samples but only a subset of the features. Some approaches exist such as FedSGD (vertical variant) and FedBCD which rely on communicating relevant information between clients to compute stochastic gradients despite only holding a portion of the features (Liu et al., 2022). However, these algorithms do not work in the hybrid FL case we are exploring. Furthermore, they require communication of this gradient information between clients instead of just passing information through the server. In addition, the convergence rate of HyFDCA in the special case of vertical FL is faster than FedBCD, demonstrating that while HyFDCA is designed to handle hybrid FL, it also enjoys improvements over existing methods in the special cases of horizontal and vertical FL. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one other algorithm that focuses on hybrid FL, HyFEM proposed by Zhang et al. (2020). This algorithm uses a feature matching formulation that balances clients building accurate local models and the server learning an accurate global model.",True,531e1bf99f0156570b93e557457d0821701dc023,A Primal-Dual Algorithm for Hybrid Federated Learning,2022.0,AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,"Tom Overman, Garrett Blum, D.

In order to further quantitatively assess the quality of our image synthesis, we calculated the structural similarity index for ground-truth pairs and ground-truth/generated image pairs on 5,650 actual and 5,650 generated images. The XDD dataset used in this work consisted of hundreds of different species that would bring the SSIM to near zero (0.00) if the images were not correlated. The lower the SSIM, the more structurally different two given images are, which denotes diversity. To that end, the calculated SSIM for groundtruth training data pairs was 0.061 ± 0.015, which indicates a highly diverse dataset. Generally, collapsed GANs would generate similar images to the training set as explained by Srivastava et al. (2017); Lala et al. (2018), and Thanh-Tung and Tran (2020). In that case, the SSIM for ground-truth and generated images for collapsed GANs would be much higher, tending to approach 1.",True,b4daea342eef1588e823c887b0856d64f54400f4,Creating High-Resolution Microscopic Cross-Section Images of Hardwood Species Using Generative Adversarial Networks,2021.0,Frontiers in Plant Science,"Dercílio Júnior Verly Lopes, Gustavo Fardin Monti, G.

Furthermore, our work is also related to the study of additive index model, which is more challenging than (1), and there is very much work in this direction. Most existing works focus on estimating the signal parameters and the link functions together in the low-dimensional setting. See Yuan (2011); Wang et al. (2015); Chen and Samworth (2016) as references. When the covariate is Gaussian and the link functions are known, Sedghi et al. (2016) proposed to estimate the signal parameters via tensor decomposition. These works are not comparable with ours as we consider a different model and our goal is to efficiently estimate the high-dimensional parameters. Last, we should also mention that our estimation methodology utilizes the generalized Stein’s identity (Stein et al., 2004), which extends the well-known Stein’s identity for Gaussian distribution (Stein, 1972) to general distributions whose density satisfies certain regularity condition. This identity is widely applied in probability, statistics, and machine learning. We point reader to Chen et al. (2011); Chwialkowski et al. (2016); Liu et al.
