(2019), accompanied by filters which are capable of retrieving features of importance required for classification. We need to use a substantial image data collection with more than 14000 images in order to finetune these networks. For instance, Kolář and Jan (2008) had detected glaucoma on the basis of fractal description which was followed up by classification. Fractal aspects can be utilized as highlights for retinal nerve fiber misfortunes recognition, which is an indication of glaucomatous eye. Maheswari et al.

3c2eb96034409c4bfdd182f2dd09b57a431ddf27,"Such result has been achieved for the case of p = 1 [Diakonikolas, 2020]. However, it is worth mentioning that the first-order method in Diakonikolas [2020] is different from first-order extragradient method and first-order dual extrapolation method which are known to achieve an optimal convergence to an ǫ-weak solution. As far as we know, it remains unclear how to design the high-order generalization of such new Halpern iteration methods. Finally, the complexity bound of O(ǫ−2/(p+1)) could not be derived beyond the monotone setting if only the Minty condition holds. Indeed, the key ingredient for proving the complexity bound of O(ǫ−2/(p+1)) is the use of averaged iterates in our new method. Such averaging technique is standard for the monotone setting but is not known to be valid yet when only the Minty condition holds. In addition, the fast convergence of Halpern iteration in Diakonikolas [2020] for achieving an ǫ-strong solution heavily relies on the monotonicity assumption and could not be extended to the setting when only the Minty condition holds.",True,fe5e9080c76fb01e1b60cbb7c19a528fa46622a5,Perseus: a simple and optimal high-order method for variational inequalities,2022.0,Mathematical programming,"Tianyi Lin, Michael I.

The key idea is to use the lower bound for finding an ǫ-weak solution [Ouyang and Xu, 2021] and the algorithmic reductions to derive lower bounds. However, such a reduction is mostly based on the high-order generalization of Halpern iteration and is thus beyond the scope of the current manuscript. In particular, we have developed a simple and optimal pth-order VI method for finding an ǫ-weak solution in the monotone setting. However, the optimal algorithm for finding an ǫ-strong solution in the monotone setting is likely to be different as evidenced by Diakonikolas [2020].
